# basis format for metadata.yaml, used by both client app and
# the essential repo updates system in our project.

# note carefully that this first item is the title that will show
# in the Finder-Viewer app, and so _must_ be short enough to fit,
# in the standard size 'card' in the app's Finder screen, as others do.
# the longTitle below lets such be in meta; no place to use it at present
title: MIT Emergency Ventilator (E-Vent)

# now, if you want a larger title available for other use, put it here (optional)
# we'll use a consistent tag naming throughout the metaData: the item by an itemname
# for its type, then optionally a lonogItemname if you want to record such.

# under languages, having description (and keywords) is critical, but it's a good idea
# to include a longDescription also, as we may in future use it, so that's shown here.
# we'll also be sensibly limited in the number of languages we'll support, and you don't
# need to have Korean. If you don't fill in a set of languages, be sure to at least fill
# in English, or get help to do so, as this will always be the fallback.

      A ventilator is a machine that provides mechanical ventilation
      by moving breathable air into and out of the lungs, to deliver breaths
      to a patient who is physically unable to breathe,
      or breathing insufficiently.

# So there's freedom to bring in other items below, according to other project
# needs, so long as you are careful and confident that they are valid Yaml.
#
# Test to be sure! Or your design might suddenly disappear from the
# web Finder. It's not something possible to protect against, so use an
# online tool, and _test_ your Yaml, please, and always. You'll have
# our thanks, and especially thanks of persons who want to use your designs.

# Note that it's critical to know that a metadata.yaml file _must not ever have_
# this trailing --- separator.

# The reason: this trailing separator indicaates there's another block to come.
# For a Markdown fine, that's true -- the main Markdown text
# But in a our simple Yaml file, there isn't more to come - and though we now
# protect, it's an error so may at some point break because what follows is empty!
