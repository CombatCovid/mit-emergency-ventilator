# Fresh basis format for metadata.yaml, responsive to the needs and
# observations of the Content Team.

# Primarily, all per-language texts are moved to short metatdata.yaml
#  within their lanauage folders. For example, ES/metadata.yaml.

#  This change means they are now very much simpler.

# This root-folder metadata.yaml remains, for the many sorts of
# information useful to document for the design, its contributors,
# and the content team.

# We leave opportunity for title/longTitle and name/nameWithOwnder here
# at least for the time being, because that may possibly be useful,
# but really for any proper software written in the future, title
# etc. information should really in many ways come from the primary
# language's metadata in the docs folder. That is the real source of truth.

# Test to be sure! Or your design might suddenly disappear from the

# online tool, and _test_ your Yaml, please, and always. You'll have
# our thanks, and especially thanks of persons who want to use your designs.

# Note that it's critical to know that a metadata.yaml file _must not ever have_
# this trailing --- separator, commented out here.

# The reason: this trailing separator indicates there's another block to come.
#
# For a Markdown fine, that's true -- the main Markdown text
# But in a our simple Yaml metadata, there isn't more to come - and though we now
# protect, it's an error so may at some point break, because what follows it is empty!
