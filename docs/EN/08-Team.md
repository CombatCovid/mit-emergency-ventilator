# Team
We are a group of engineers, clinicians and other experts working to make a difference as best we can. We have diverse skills and heritages, but we are all nerds. Over March and April 2020 , working 7 days a week, dawn to dusk and beyond, we have become a family. We are all part of this team on a volunteer basis.

Constructive comments are welcome from any and all individuals who would like to contribute; this is essential to ensuring a world-wide team effort. Please use the comment feature on the appropriate page. We have multiple people monitoring this site frequently.

If you have substantial information to share or contribute that requests direct attention, you may contact the team directly. We appreciate your insights, and apologize when we cannot reply to everyone individually. Do note that we are releasing information as fast as it is available.

Media contacts should be directed to the MIT Media Team.

Finally, our thoughts are with all the healthcare workers on the front lines and the patients battling this illness, those keeping grocery stores, pharmacies, and critical infrastructure functioning worldwide, and everyone who has been affected by this pandemic.
