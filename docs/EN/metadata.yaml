# This is basis format for per-language folder metadata.yaml, used by
# the client app and its essential repo Index updates system in our project.

# note carefully that this first item is the title that will show
# in the Finder-Viewer app, and so _must_ be short enough to fit,
# in the standard size 'card' in the app's Finder screen, as others do.
# the longTitle below lets such be in meta; no place to use it at present
title: MIT Emergency Ventilator (E-Vent)

# now, if you want a larger title available for other use, put it here (optional)
# we'll use a consistent tag naming throughout the metaData: the item by an itemname
# for its type, then optionally a lonogItemname if you want to record such.

# under languages, having description (and keywords) is critical, but it's a good idea
# to include a longDescription also, as we may in future use it, so that's shown here.
# we'll also be sensibly limited in the number of languages we'll support, and you don't
# need to have Korean. If you don't fill in a set of languages, be sure to at least fill
# in English, or get help to do so, as this will always be the fallback.

description: A low-cost ventilator, based on the collective wisdom of many clinicians

longDescription: >
  A ventilator is a machine that provides mechanical ventilation
  by moving breathable air into and out of the lungs, to deliver breaths
  to a patient who is physically unable to breathe,
  or breathing insufficiently.

# These added items that follow will come to be part of the Finder material,
# which can be shown with a quick touch or click, because they are powerful
# shorthand first judgemen factors. Thus they need translation as well.
medicalOpinion: >
  Not available from independent experts yet, but it appears
  there was a substantial medical sight on the design, and it
  appears there are quite thoughtful
  cautionary notes in the build directions.
buildDifficulty: >
  Again, important notes in the design documents, discussing
  risks inherent in use, which will reflect also on precision, care,
  and quality needed in construction
relative cost: >
  This is felt to be a low cost solution. (expand, but with due care,
  figures very preferable. $100? But fact check, assure.
