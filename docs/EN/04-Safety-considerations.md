# Safety and sterilization and verification
The big question is the sterility of the production environment and the finished parts. You really don’t want to make things worse by producing things meant to fight the disease, while accidentally spreading it. ALWAYS check with a professional to ensure your setup or production is up to their standards and don’t be offended if they are cautious to accept your help. 

**Keep in mind that the virus can live on the plastic for 48-90 hours and plastics cannot be easily sterilized after use. So they are one-use only, at least until we find a way to reliably sterilize the printed parts!**

Here are the precautions we are taking (these also apply to other 3D printed designs out there) and they are still pending validation – always check for updates of this article.

- The plastic is heated up to a high temperature during printing pretty much sterilizing the printed part, don’t let the part sit on the bed for hours where it can be contaminated again. Wear a fresh pair of gloves and surgical mask before removing the prints and put it directly into a fresh sealable bag. In our farm, we have the air completely exchanged every 2 minutes and it is filtered, this greatly helps reduce anything harmful in the air.
- When lasering the clear shields, leave the protective foils on so it can be removed before assembly and use. This greatly reduces any possible contamination. Also, pack it as an entire batch your laser can make at a time. Our laser can make 40pcs in one go, so when we open the laser, we collect all of them at once – again in fresh gloves while wearing a surgical mask. We put them into a sealable bag immediately. If your laser can only produce one at a time, make sure you are wearing fresh gloves for each part you produce.
- When cutting the elastic, we also wear gloves and surgical masks. Do not unpack more than you need to work on, reducing exposure to the air will reduce contamination.


## If you want to manufacture shields for others

**PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY**

1. Act as if you were infected by the COVID-19 virus. Wear a face mask and a fresh pair of gloves when collecting each batch of printed parts. Store the parts immediately in a sealable bag.

2. Talk with whoever you’re making the shields for, let them know about your manufacturing environment

3. There is still debate about how long the virus survives on plastic, but most sources mention 2-3 days. That means that by letting the packed face shields sit for 2-3 days before distributing them, you’ll greatly reduce risk of transmission

4. Do not store the entire stock in one place, minimize the risk of cross-contamination
